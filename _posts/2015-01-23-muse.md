title: 'muse: a CMS scaffolding tool'

## The Beginning 

Muse is my first open source project. I tend to be a bad developer sometimes by keeping everything I do and learn to myself. So as I was working on a side project I started thinking about how nice it would be if I could just spin this boilerplate code up whenever I needed it; similar to a Yeoman generator but a bit more advanced. And I also thought that if I would find this tool useful maybe others would too. So sent my code out into the world for the masses to evaluate? They might hate it, but that's not the point. The point is that I would have done it.

Now the caveat... I haven't done it. At least not yet. All I've done as of now is set up the project structure and decide on my next steps of action, which you will find below in the form of a task list.

## Step 0

The list of development tasks for muse that I think are top priority:

+ Finalize default configuration and structure
  + Basic mongoose models and CRUD operations for Users, Pages, Blogs, and Posts
  + Separate view routes from API routes in preparation for client-side framework support
+ User Authentication (Passport)
  + Basic user auth
  + OAuth support for Google+, Twitter, and Facebook
  + Both
+ Blog functionality
  + Single blog with multiple posts (without comments)
  + Single blog with multiple posts (with comments)
+ Admin functionality without permissions
+ Admin functionality with roles and multi-part permissions
  + Content creation and editing
  + Content publication
  + Content deletion
  + User viewing
  + User creation and editing
+ Navigation
  + Single top level page routing
