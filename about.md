I use Evernote, Sublime, regular notepads, the back of printed handouts, or whatever I can find at the moment to try and keep track or my thoughts or ideas. Sometimes whatever I have at the moment works just fine and is all I need. However, I started to notice that this was not effective was when it came to code. Now if I'm coding something or even writing sudo code chances are I'm at my computer. I'm not such a hardcore programmer that I have coding dreams about a beautiful algorithm that could change the world. When I dream about code it's usually in nightmare form and I'm stuck in an infinite loop or failing the same test over and over again. 

So the problem was I needed a place to keep not just code but coding solutions or even just explorations. Yes, most of the time I can get them into Evernote but I find that I'll just jot down a thought or two and then multiple code copy and pastes, which is not really a well formed idea at all. Yes, if I could get myself into the same mindset I was in when I wrote these blurbs I could probably replicate the outcome again, but it would be much easier if I actually took the time to formulate whole thoughts and a process which I could follow to get from A to Z again. Plus I missed my syntax highlighting. So someone told me I should just keep a blog and I visibly *cringed*. I don't really enjoy writing down my thoughts and then sending them out into the world, but that's my problem——a problem I decided I wanted to work on. So here it is! **My tech blog**.
