# git kitty

Git kitty is the name of my blog. This space acts as a place to organize notes, thoughts, explorations, and solutions where all can see. It is built on [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), a static site generator in Ruby using Markdown and Liquid converters to create a ready-to-publish website. This site is hosted on AWS S3 utilizing Route 53 as a DNS and CloudFront as the CDN.
